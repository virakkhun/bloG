### Description

This app is build with React 18.x . The purpose of this app is to create a simple weather statistic with a minimal information.
The app is using `open weather api` a greate api ever. Redux Toolkit is being used as an State Management, purposely for learning.
For styling, `TailwindCSS` one of the greatest CSS framework ever. Weather App is the most popular `React App` out there. 
I'm exploring more about `React`. The most interesting thing about `React` for me is **useEffect**.
